### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am **Shivaraj**. I am a curious Software Engineer working with BlueYonder India Pvt Ltd. I am passionate about technology and always try to find opportunities to learn new stuff. I have worked on multiple projects and my contributions span across frontend and backend. I have special interest in cloud native technologies and microservices. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Microservice Communication
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Microservices with gRPC
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, Backend Development etc.
- ðŸš§ Work in progress: Builiding a simple project to demonstrate Microservices with gRPC
